🤖 AI-Driven Tic Tac Toe 🎮

Hey there 👋 This is my take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game — but with a smart twist.
Instead of random moves, this one uses AI-style logical reasoning to challenge you!
It’s simple, colorful, and built entirely in Python (with Tkinter GUI).

🧠 What It Does?

You play against an AI opponent that doesn’t just guess — it thinks.
Using a knowledge-based system and propositional logic, the AI checks the board, predicts your next move, and tries to win (or block you) intelligently.

It’s a cool example of how logic-based AI reasoning can make a simple game feel strategic and fun.

✨ Features

Smart AI that plays using rule-based reasoning

Beautiful Tkinter GUI with color feedback

Displays “AI Wins”, “You Win”, or “Draw” after each round

Restart option to play again instantly

Beginner-friendly and easy to customize

Demonstrates knowledge-based decision making in action

⚙️ How It Works

The program sets up a 3×3 Tic Tac Toe board.

The AI uses predefined rules like:

“If AI can win in one move → make that move.”

“If the player can win in one move → block them.”

“Otherwise, choose the best available cell.”

The inference engine applies these rules to choose the best logical move.

The Tkinter GUI updates instantly to show the move, highlight winners, and show results.

You can restart anytime and challenge the AI again.

It’s not deep learning or neural nets — but it’s a great way to see how computers can “reason” logically.

🧩 Why I Made It

I wanted to make something that’s:

Fun and interactive 🎯

Quick to build 💡

Easy to understand for beginners 🧩

Still showcases how AI decision logic works 🤖

This project shows that even simple rule-based AI can make games engaging and a little smarter.

🚀 How to Run It

Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-tic-tac-toe.git


Move into the folder:

cd ai-tic-tac-toe


Run the game:

python tic_tac_toe_ai.py


That’s it — the GUI pops up, and you’re ready to play against your AI opponent! 🧠💥

🔮 Future Ideas

Add multiple AI difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Use Minimax algorithm or Reinforcement Learning for smarter AI

Add sound effects, animations, and custom themes

Introduce multiplayer mode for online play

Voice control to make moves using speech commands 🎙️

👋 About Me

I’m Arsheen Fathima , a Computer Science (AI & ML) student who enjoys building fun, logic-driven projects.
This Tic Tac Toe AI was a mini-project that turned out to be a great mix of coding, logic, and creativity.

If you like games that think back, you’ll enjoy this one 😄
